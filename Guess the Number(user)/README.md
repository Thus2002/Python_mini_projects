# Computer Guessing Game

This Python program is a guessing game where the computer tries to guess a number that the user has chosen within a specified range.

# How to Play

1. Run the 'computer_guess(x)' function, where 'x' is the maximum number allowed in the range.
2. Think of a number between 1 and 'x', inclusive.
3. The computer will start guessing numbers within this range and prompt you to provide feedback on each guess.
4. If the computer's guess is too high, type 'H'. If it's too low, type 'L'. If it's correct, type 'C'.
5. The game continues until the computer guesses the correct number.
6. Once the computer guesses the number correctly, the program will display a congratulatory message.
